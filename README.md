# Fake News Detection

## 1. Description  
Misinformation and fake news are increasingly prevalent online, influencing public opinion and decision-making.  
This project aims to develop a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** model that can classify news articles as **"reliable" or "fake"** by analyzing their textual content.

## 2. Goal  
- Build an accurate **fake news classification model**.  
- Scrape and process real-world news articles from fact-checking websites.  
- Experiment with different **NLP techniques** (e.g., BERT, TF-IDF with logistic regression).  
- Visualize key findings through **word clouds and confusion matrices**.

## 3. Data Collection  
- **Sources**: Fact-checking platforms like **Politifact** and **Snopes**.  
- **Method**: Web scraping and dataset integration.  
- **Features**: Headline, article content, source, publication date, fact-check labels.  

## 4. Modeling Approach  
We plan to implement a **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model**.  
As the semester progresses, we will further explore and refine this approach.

## 5. Visualization  
- **Word Clouds** to analyze common words in fake vs. real news.  
- **Confusion Matrices** to evaluate model performance.  
- **User-friendly Interface** to receive input and display results.  

## 6. Test Plan  
- **Dataset Split**: 80% training, 20% testing.  
- **Real-world Testing**: Apply the trained model to newly scraped articles.
