    In a world flooded with misinformation, our project uses Natural Language
    Processing (NLP) to help identify whether news articles are reliable or
    fake. Trained on real-world data from fact-checking sites like Politifact
    and Snopes, our model analyzes article content and delivers fast,
    informative results â€” all through a simple, user-friendly interface.
