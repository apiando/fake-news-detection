  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    In today’s digital world, misinformation spreads faster than ever. At Fake
    News Inspector, our goal is to help you separate fact from fiction. Using
    advanced AI and real-time fact-checking, we analyze news articles, social
    media posts, and online sources to determine their credibility.

  <h2>How We Work</h2>
  <p>
    Our platform leverages machine learning, natural language processing (NLP),
    BERT, and expert verification to evaluate the authenticity of news. We
    provide transparency by highlighting trusted sources, detecting bias, and
    flagging suspicious content so that you can make informed decisions.
